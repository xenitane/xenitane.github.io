What if I told you that there is a way by which you can shrink the width/height of an image without losing whole objects i.e. people, buildings etc&hellip; without any fancy AI, that too using a simple C-Program.

Sounds too good to be true, but it is. This application right here is an implementation of one such algorithm which can achieve what I mentioned earlier.
