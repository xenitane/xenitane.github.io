If you are a fellow linux user and have distro-hopped, or ran into an issue which forced you to install the OS again. You might lose all the system and environment config that you put your heart and soul into, you will understand the need for this.

The aim of this project of mine was to manage my personal environment configuration that can be cloned and used on any Linux system I'll have in the future with minimal human intervention.
