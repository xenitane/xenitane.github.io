Firstly yes, you read the name right. When I embarked on my journey to make a programming language, I took the recommended course of action, implement a compiler/interpreter for an existing one.

And what's a better starting point than the implementation of a simple **_turing machine_** with no state and minimal instruction set.

This implementation add the feature of JIT-ting, for compressing repeated operations.

It would be an understatement for me to say that the person who came up was a genius madman.
