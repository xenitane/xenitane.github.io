A simple web application I built after learning about fractal geometry from a **_3blue1brown_** video, for generating these intricate yet unassumingly mesmerising shapes.

Now, it's evolving from just fractals to more mathematical structures, and as I add them I too uncover more about mathematics, geometry and how to program these things.
