A simple web application I built after learning about fractal geometry from a ***3blue1brown*** video, for generating these intricate yet unassumingly mesmerising shapes.

Now, it's evolving from just fractals to more mathematical structures, and as I add them I too uncover more about mathematics, geometry and how to programm these things.
