## Projects

### B Compiler | **WORK IN PROGRESS**

Individual Project _(Jun 2025)_

- An attempt at writing a compiler for the B programming language, the predecessor of C, designed by _Ken Thompson_.
- The intent is to make it a cross-target compiler for multiple OS’s and Architectures.
- Learning instruction models and methods of optimizations while generating assembly and machine level code from higher level languages.
- **Tech**: Zig, x86 Assembly, Arm Assembly, 6502 Architecture

### Tasks Manager

Individual Project _(Aug 2024)_

- A simple task tracking application back-end written in go.
- Features JWT based Authorization.
- Has all the standard planner’s features implemented.
- **Tach**: Go, Fiber, Postgres

### Seam Carver

Individual Project _(Apr 2024)_

- An implementation of the seam-carving algorithm in C.
- This Algorithm resizes an image across one axis without losing details.
- This Algorithm does not require any ML models to achieve the aforementioned goal, instead by removing pixels along a seam in the orthogonal axis after a computation to determine an energy value of that seam.
- **Tech**: C

### JIT Compiler for BarinFuck

Individual Project _(Feb 2024)_

- A compiler for BrainFuck, using JIT compilation for optimization.
- Compared to a standard compiler, this minimizes instruction cycles by merging similar instructions into one.
- **Tech**: C, x86 Assembly

### Geo Vis

Individual Project _(Feb 2024)_
